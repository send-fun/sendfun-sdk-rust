# sendfun-sdk

Rust SDK for the send.fun programs on Solana.

- `launchpad`: token creation, bonding curve trades, migration.
- `dex`: AMM trades after migration.
- `nexus`: staking and partner fees.

The SDK builds instructions, decodes accounts and events, and calculates quotes.
It does not send transactions.

## Install

```sh
cargo add sendfun-sdk
```

Optional features:

- `fetch`: RPC account fetchers such as `launchpad::accounts::fetch_bonding_curve`.
- `serde`: `Serialize` and `Deserialize` on accounts, events and types.
- `anchor`: `anchor-lang` interop for on-chain callers.

## Rules

- Read `platform_config` from the bonding curve or the pool. Do not use your
  own platform key.
- A partner other than `DEFAULT_PARTNER` must sign.
- Get a platform key with `constants::find_platform_address(slug)`.
- Do not edit the `generated` modules. They come from the program IDLs.
